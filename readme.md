# Encryption PoC
This is a basic file encrytion and decryption test written in python3. The single goal of this was to test encrypting and decrypting data in a simple way.



### To encrypt
- Update line 38 in [filencrypt.py](https://github.com/I14T-E/encryption-test/filencrypt.py "filencrypt.py")
- Execute the script
- **NOTE: The encryption key will be overwritten if the script is run twice in a row as a new key is created every time the script is written**


### To decrypt
- Update line 27 in [decrypt.py](https://github.com/I14T-E/encryption-test/decrypt.py "decrypt.py")
- Execute the script

_WARNING: USE WITH CAUTION_
